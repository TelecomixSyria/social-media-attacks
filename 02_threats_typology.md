## Typology of threats
Here we should describe the threats, their effect, how they are conducted, etc. We may have to add a link to non social media based attacks, as they are all just a tool to achieve some goal.

### Intelligence gathering from public data
Fetching data from social networks to gather information on people. This includes pictures, social relations, political opinions, etc. They only entail using publicly available data.

### Attacks on confidential and private data
#### Phishing
[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) consists in designing fake login pages for usual online services (social media, banks, etc.), putting these pages online and spreading the links to the fake page in order to retrieve peoples' credentials.

It is easy to setup, requires very little technical skills and no money.

At the same time, obtaining someone's credentials may have very serious consequences. On social media services where a lot of personal life data is stored, compromised credentials may lead to the compromission of the following information:

- friends and family links;
- conversations;
- etc.

#### Impersonation
An attacker may be able to impersonate a victim. This may be done after a phishing: it gives the attacker a very good way to use the trusted status of the victim in front of its contacts. It can also be done without phishing, though with a lower effectiveness: a new social media account may be created under a fake name.

This may allow the person to gather more information from the victim's contacts, as well as to spread malicious links to the victim's trustful contacts. This malicious links could lead to malwares which could lead to further more information gathering.

#### Malwares
Malicious software applications (malwares), and more particularly spywares, are used to spy directly a person's activity on their device. This in turns may allow to fetch credentials, to download data located on the user's device, etc.

#### Eavesdropping
"Lawful" interception by local authorities or network administrators, ISPs, wireless sniffing, etc.

### Attacks on public information
#### Content deletion
Social media often feature "report as spam" or "report as abuse" functionality, with the primary goal to allow viewers to report abusive content or spamming comments. When enough reports are issued, automatic content deletion mechanisms can be triggered.

This may affect content, such as YouTube videos, or complete social media accounts, such as on Twitter.

Online content may sometimes reveal evidence about a particular event. For instance, a video posted online may show violence from local security forces. Some authorities may then massively use the "report as spam" function to erase such evidence and hence delete information.

More generally, this action consists in denying the existence of an information that ought to be publicly available.

#### Opinion influencing
Organized groups, either paid by local authorities or not, sometimes massively post comments on videos or articles with the objective to give the impression that a large mass of people agree on some opinion.

This phenomenon also happens through the writing of blogposts.

### Analysis and reassembling of scattered data into intelligence
Scattered data fetched from various means, from account compromission to search through publicly available content, leads to reconstructing precise pictures about people.
