## Recommandations
This last part aims at giving recommandations to address to threats described above.

- having several social media accounts for plausable deniability;
- using alternative, more discrete and less intrusive communication services (XMPP, ...);
- encryption against eavesdropping;
- remembering that a name on a social media does not prove identity (real authentication only works through cryptographic methods and human interation);
- mirror content to avoid its loss if deleted from social media (the Streisand effect);
- use a media that uses interoperable format for easier republication, and that does not have the "report as abuse" functionnality to avoid content suppression, as primary publication place (from which it can be pushed to any other mainstream online media)
- avoid phishing links;
