## Recommandations
This last part aims at giving recommandations to address to threats described above.

- having several social media accounts for plausable deniability;
- using alternative, more discrete and less intrusive communication services (XMPP, ...);
- encryption against eavesdropping;
- remembering that a name on a social media does not prove identity (real authentication only works through cryptographic methods and human interation);
- mirror content to avoid its loss if deleted from social media (the Streisand effect);
- avoid phishing links;
