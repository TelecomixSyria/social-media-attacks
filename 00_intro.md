# Social media based attacks

This document aims at describing attacks based on social media tools. They may be used against people or against the spreading of information. They exploit the possibilities offered by social media tools.

Through describing the existing threats, this document also aims at providing advices to reduce the risks yielded by these threats.

We here try to define what a "social media" is, in a more generic way than just through the usual examples like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. We consider as a social media, an online service that bases the spreading of information on social links between individuals.

These social links take a varied form and have varying implications from a service to another. They can be related to real friendship but may also be related to the structure of (informal) groups or organizations. They can also be related to the sharing of personal topics of interest.

From that, we can derive wider examples of social networks: Khodnevis, Weibo, Orkut, Netjournal, vk.com, Google+, Github, etc.
